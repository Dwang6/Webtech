		My website is about traveling. The focus will be on major cities around the world. These cities can range from New York City, to Barcelona, to Johannesburg. The purpose of this website will be similar to that of a travel advisory sites. It will detail some of the major cities around the world as well as what attractions are available in every site. The categories can include the history of the city, major cultural and tourist sites, night life, and recommended restaurants. With the globalization of the world as it is today, it is becoming increasingly easier to travel and experience new cities. However, with so much information out there regarding every location, sometimes it might be easier for the consumer to have everything located in one website.

		My target audience would be college students preparing to travel. When I studied abroad last year, one of my biggest challenges was choosing which cities to go to, and what to do once I got to those cities. Planning my course of the action from the day including where to go and eat, was always difficult as there was so much information online that is not condensed into one space. For this reason, I want to create a website for college students in the same situation to have an easier time planning their trips so that they can focus more on enjoying these cities.

		My plan for the website will be similar to the map exercise we did in class. I will have a world map with clickable points. These points will be countries and I will have a detailed analysis of the background of a major city within that country. I plan to have between 5 to 10 cities in which there will be a re-direct link to. Once arrived at the city’s website, there will be a picture of the overall city at the top of the page with a heading of the city name within but in front of the picture. Below will be a table of contents with the categories of history, major sites, night life attractions, and recommended restaurants. The “history” will redirect to the Wikipedia page on the city. The “major sites” and “night life” attractions links will be a list with pictures of the major tourist attractions. The “recommended restaurants” category will be similar to that of the “major sites” and “night life” category, with the added benefit of having links to the corresponding Yelp pages. Every page will have a home button that will link back to the previous page, whether that is the city’s main page, or the world map.
